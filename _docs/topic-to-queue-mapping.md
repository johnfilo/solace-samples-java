title: Topic to Queue Mapping
---

This tutorial builds on the basic concepts introduced in [Persistence with Queues]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/persistence-with-queues) tutorial and will show you how to make use of one of Solace’s advanced queueing features called “Topic to Queue Mapping.”

In addition to spooling messages published directly to the queue, it is possible to add one or more topic subscriptions to a durable queue so that messages published to those topics are also delivered to and spooled by the queue. This is a powerful feature that enables queues to participate equally in point to point and publish / subscribe messaging models. More details about the [“Topic to Queue Mapping” feature here](http://dev.solacesystems.com/docs/core-concepts/#topic-queue-mapping){:target="_top"}.

The following diagram illustrates this feature.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/topic-to-queue-mapping-detail.png" width="500" height="206" />

If you have a durable queue named `Q`, it will receive messages published directly to the queue destination named `Q`. However, it is also possible to add subscriptions to this queue in the form of topics. This example adds topics `A` and `B`. Once these subscriptions are added, the queue will start receiving messages published to the topic destinations `A` and `B`. When you combine this with the wildcard support provided by Solace topics this opens up a number of interesting use cases.

## Assumptions

This tutorial assumes the following:

*   You are familiar with Solace [core concepts](http://dev.solacesystems.com/docs/core-concepts/){:target="_top"}.
*   You have access to a running Solace message router with the following configuration:
    *   Enabled message VPN configured for guaranteed messaging support.
    *   Enabled client username.
    *   Client-profile enabled with guaranteed messaging permissions.
*   You understand the basics introduced in [Persistence with Queues]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/persistence-with-queues)

Note that one simple way to get access to a Solace message router is to start a Solace VMR load [as outlined here](http://dev.solacesystems.com/docs/get-started/setting-up-solace-vmr_vmware/){:target="_top"}. By default the Solace VMR will with the “default” message VPN configured and ready for guaranteed messaging. Going forward, this tutorial assumes that you are using the Solace VMR. If you are using a different Solace message router configuration adapt the tutorial appropriately to match your configuration.

## Goals

The goal of this tutorial is to understand the following:

1.  How to add topic subscriptions to a queue
2.  How to interrogate the Solace message router to confirm capabilities.

## Trying it yourself

This tutorial is available in [GitHub]({{ site.repository }}){:target="_blank"} along with the other [Getting Started Examples]({{ site.baseurl }}/).

To successfully build the samples you must have the Java API downloaded and available. The Java API library can be [downloaded here](http://dev.solacesystems.com/downloads/){:target="_top"}. The Java API is distributed as a zip file containing the required jars, API documentation, and examples.

At the end, this tutorial walks through downloading and running the sample from source.

## Connection setup

First, connect to the Solace message router in almost exactly the same way as other tutorials. The difference is highlighted in bold and explained below.

```java
final JCSMPProperties properties = new JCSMPProperties();
properties.setProperty(JCSMPProperties.HOST, args[0]);
properties.setProperty(JCSMPProperties.VPN_NAME, "default");
properties.setProperty(JCSMPProperties.USERNAME, "queueTutorial");
// Make sure that the session is tolerant of the subscription<
// already existing on the queue.
properties.setProperty(JCSMPProperties.IGNORE_DUPLICATE_SUBSCRIPTION_ERROR, true);

final JCSMPSession session = JCSMPFactory.onlyInstance().createSession(properties);
session.connect();
```

The only difference in the above is the duplicate subscription processing boolean. One aspect to consider when adding subscriptions is how your application wishes the Solace API to behave in the face of pre-existing duplicate subscriptions. The default behavior is to throw an exception if an application tries to add a subscription that already exists. In this tutorial, we’ll relax that behavior and change our JCSMPSession so that it will tolerate the subscription already existing. For more details on this session flag, refer to the [product documentation for the Java API](http://dev.solacesystems.com/docs/enterprise-api-docs/){:target="_top"}.

## Review: Receiving message from a queue

The [Persistence with Queues]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/persistence-with-queues) tutorial demonstrated how to publish and receive messages from a queue. In doing this it used a JCSMPSession, XMLMessageProducer, and Consumer and this sample will do so in the same way. This sample will also depend on the endpoint being provisioned by through the API as was done in the previous tutorial. For clarity, this code is not repeated in the discussion but is included in the full working sample available in the summary section.

## Confirming Message Router Capabilities

One convenient feature provided by the Java API is the Session capabilities. When a JCSMPSession connect to a Solace message router, they exchange a set of capabilities to determine levels of support for various API features. This enables the Solace APIs to remain compatible with Solace message routers even as they are upgraded to new loads.

Applications can also make use of these capabilities to programmatically check for required features when connecting. The following code is an example of how this is done for the capabilities required by this tutorial.

```java
if (session.isCapable(CapabilityType.PUB_GUARANTEED) &&
    session.isCapable(CapabilityType.SUB_FLOW_GUARANTEED) &&
    session.isCapable(CapabilityType.ENDPOINT_MANAGEMENT) &&
    session.isCapable(CapabilityType.QUEUE_SUBSCRIPTIONS)) {
    System.out.println("All required capabilities supported!");
} else {
    System.out.println("Capabilities not met!");
    System.exit(1);
}
```

In this case the tutorial requires permission to send and receive guaranteed messages, configure endpoints and manage queue subscriptions. If these capabilities are not available on the message router the tutorial will not proceed. If these capabilities are missing, you update the client-profile used by the client-username to enable them. See the [SolAdmin User Guide – Configuring Clients](https://sftp.solacesystems.com/Portal_Docs/#page/SolAdmin_User_Guide/Configuring_Clients.html){:target="_top"} for details.

## Adding a Subscription to a Queue

In order to enable a queue to participate in publish/subscribe messaging, you need to add topic subscriptions to the queue to attract messages. You do this from the JCSMPSession using the addSubscription() method. The queue destination is passed as the first argument and then topic subscription to add and any flags. This example asks the API to block until the subscription is confirmed to be on the Solace message router. The subscription added in this tutorial is `Q/tutorial/topicToQueueMapping`.

```java
Queue queue = JCSMPFactory.onlyInstance().createQueue("Q/tutorial/topicToQueueMapping");
Topic tutorialTopic = JCSMPFactory.onlyInstance().createTopic("T/mapped/topic/sample");
session.addSubscription(queue, tutorialTopic, JCSMPSession.WAIT_FOR_CONFIRM);
```

## Publish – Subscribe using a Queue

Once the subscription is added to the queue, all that is left to do in this tutorial is to send some messages to your topic and validate that they arrive on the queue. First publish some messages using the following code:

```java
TextMessage msg =  JCSMPFactory.onlyInstance().createMessage(TextMessage.class);
msg.setDeliveryMode(DeliveryMode.PERSISTENT);
for (int i = 1; i <= count; i++) {
    msg.setText("Message number " + i);
    prod.send(msg, tutorialTopic);
}
```

These messages are now on your queue. You can validate this through SolAdmin by inspecting the queue. Now receive the messages using a flow consumer as outlined in detail in previous tutorials.

```java
ConsumerFlowProperties flow_prop = new ConsumerFlowProperties();
flow_prop.setEndpoint(queue);
Consumer cons = session.createFlow(new SimplePrintingMessageListener(), flow_prop);
cons.start();

try {
    latch.await(); // block here until message received, and latch will flip
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    System.out.println("I was awoken while waiting");
}
```

## Summarizing

The full source code for this example is available in [GitHub]({{ site.repository }}){:target="_blank"}. If you combine the example source code shown above results in the following source:

*   [TopicToQueueMapping.java]({{ site.repository }}/blob/master/src/main/java/com/solacelabs/getstarted/TopicToQueueMapping.java)


### Getting the Source

Clone the GitHub repository containing the Solace samples.

```
git clone {{ site.repository }}
cd solace-getting-started-java
```

### Building

Building these examples is simple.  Download and unpacked the Java API library to a known location. Then copy the contents of the `sol-jcsmp-VERSION/lib` directory to a `libs` sub-directory in your `solace-getting-started-java`.

In the following command line replace VERSION with the Solace API version you downloaded.

```
mkdir libs
cp  ../sol-jcsmp-VERSION/lib/* libs
```

Now you can simply build the project using Gradle.

```
./gradlew assemble
```

This build all of the Java Getting Started Samples with OS specific launch scripts. The files are staged in the `build/staged` directory.

### Running the Sample

Run the example from the command line as follows.

```
$ ./build/staged/bin/topicToQueueMapping HOST
```

You have now added a topic subscription to a queue and successfully published persistent messages to the topic and had them arrive on your Queue endpoint.

If you have any issues sending and receiving a message, check the [Solace community](http://dev.solacesystems.com/community/){:target="_top"} for answers to common issues.
