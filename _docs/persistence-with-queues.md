title: Persistence with Queues
---
This tutorial builds on the basic concepts introduced in the [publish/subscribe tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/publish-subscribe), and will show you how to send
and receive persistent messages from a Solace message router queue in a point to point fashion.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/persistence-tutorial.png)

## Assumptions

This tutorial assumes the following:

*   You are familiar with Solace [core concepts](http://dev.solacesystems.com/docs/core-concepts/){:target="_top"}.
*   You have access to a running Solace message router with the following configuration:
    *   Enabled message VPN
    *   Enabled client username
    *   Client-profile enabled with guaranteed messaging permissions.

One simple way to get access to a Solace message router is to start a Solace VMR load [as outlined here](http://dev.solacesystems.com/docs/get-started/setting-up-solace-vmr_vmware/){:target="_top"}. By default the Solace VMR will run with the “default” message VPN configured and ready for messaging. Going forward, this tutorial assumes that you are using the Solace VMR. If you are using a different Solace message router configuration, adapt the instructions to match your configuration.

## Goals

The goal of this tutorial is to understand the following:

1.  How to programmatically create a durable queue on the Solace message router
2.  How to send a persistent message to a Solace queue
3.  How to bind to this queue and receive a persistent message

## Solace message router properties

As with other tutorials, this tutorial will connect to the default message VPN of a Solace VMR which has authentication disabled. So the only required information to proceed is the Solace VMR host string which this tutorial accepts as an argument.

## Trying it yourself

This tutorial is available in [GitHub]({{ site.repository }}){:target="_blank"} along with the other [Getting Started Examples]({{ site.baseurl }}/).

To successfully build the samples you must have the Java API downloaded and available. The Java API library can be [downloaded here](http://dev.solacesystems.com/downloads/){:target="_top"}. The Java API is distributed as a zip file containing the required jars, API documentation, and examples.

At the end, this tutorial walks through downloading and running the sample from source.

## Provisioning a Queue through the API

</div>

The first requirement for guaranteed messaging using a Solace message router is to provision a guaranteed message endpoint. For this tutorial we will use a point-to-point queue. To learn more about different guaranteed message endpoints see [here](http://dev.solacesystems.com/docs/core-concepts/#endpoints){:target="_top"}.

Durable endpoints are not auto created on Solace message routers. However there are two ways to provision them.

*   Using the management interface
*   Using the APIs

Using the Solace APIs to provision an endpoint can be a convenient way of getting started quickly without needing to become familiar with the management interface. This is why it is used in this tutorial. However it should be noted that the management interface provides more options to control the queue properties. So generally it becomes the preferred method over time.

Provisioning an endpoint through the API requires the “Guaranteed Endpoint Create” permission in the client-profile. You can confirm this is enabled by looking at the client profile in SolAdmin. If it is correctly set you will see the following:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/persistence-tutoral-image-3.png)

Provisioning the queue involves three steps.

*   Obtaining a Java API Queue object representing the queue you wish to create.
*   Setting the Queue properties that you wish for your queue. This examples permits consumption of messages and sets the queue type to exclusive. More details on queue permissions can be found in the [Java developer documentation](http://dev.solacesystems.com/docs/enterprise-api-docs/){:target="_top"}.
*   Provisioning the Queue on the Solace message router

The following code shows you this for the queue named `Q/tutorial`.

~~~java
// create the queue object locally
String queueName = "Q/tutorial";
final Queue queue = JCSMPFactory.onlyInstance().createQueue(queueName);

// set queue permissions to "consume" and access-type to "exclusive"
final EndpointProperties endpointProps = new EndpointProperties();
endpointProps.setPermission(EndpointProperties.PERMISSION_CONSUME);
endpointProps.setAccessType(EndpointProperties.ACCESSTYPE_EXCLUSIVE);

// Actually provision it, and do not fail if it already exists
session.provision(queue, endpointProps, JCSMPSession.FLAG_IGNORE_ALREADY_EXISTS);
~~~

The ignore already exists flags signals to the API that the application is tolerate of the queue already existing even if it’s properties are different than those specified in the endpoint properties.

## Sending a message to a queue

Now it is time to send a message to the queue.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/sending-message-to-queue-300x160.png)

There is really no difference in the actual calls to the JCSMP message producer when sending a persistent message as compared to a direct message shown in the publish/subscribe tutorial. The difference in the persistent message is that the Solace message router will acknowledge the message once it is successfully stored on the message router.

This is still handled by the message producer event handler and again producers can implement either the `JCSMPStreamingPublishEventHandler` or the `JCSMPStreamingPublishCorrelatingEventHandler`. The `JCSMPStreamingPublishEventHandler` is the simplest and is sufficient for basic message persistence. The tutorial on handling acknowledgements will get into more advanced acknowledgement handling with proper correlation.

So the message producer creation code can remain the same as shown here:

```java
XMLMessageProducer prod = session.getMessageProducer(new JCSMPStreamingPublishEventHandler() {
    public void responseReceived(String messageID) {
        System.out.println("Producer received response for msg: " + messageID);
    }
    public void handleError(String messageID, JCSMPException e, long timestamp) {
        System.out.printf("Producer received error for msg: %s@%s - %s%n",messageID,timestamp,e);
    }
});
```

To send a message, you must still create a message. The main difference from sending a direct message is that you must set the message delivery mode to persistent. When you send the message you also update the call to send to include your queue object as the destination.

```java
final Topic topic = JCSMPFactory.onlyInstance().createTopic("tutorial/topic");
TextMessage msg = JCSMPFactory.onlyInstance().createMessage(TextMessage.class);
msg.setDeliveryMode(DeliveryMode.PERSISTENT);
String text = "Persistent Queue Tutorial! " +
        DateFormat.getDateTimeInstance().format(new Date());
msg.setText(text);
prod.send(msg, queue);
```

At this point the producer has sent a message to the Solace message router and it will be waiting for your consumer on the queue.

## Receiving a message from a queue

Now it is time to receive the messages sent to your queue.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/receiving-message-from-queue-300x160.png)

You still need to connect a session just as you did with the publisher. With a connected session, you then need to bind to the Solace message router queue with a flow receiver. Flow receivers allow applications to receive messages from a Solace guaranteed message flow. Flows encapsulate all of the acknowledgement behavior required for guaranteed messaging. Conveniently flow receivers have the same interface as message consumers but flows also require some additional properties on creation.

First a flow requires consumer properties. At its most basic, the consumer flow properties require the queue name and an ack mode. In this example you’ll use the client ack mode where the application will explicitly acknowledge each message.

```java
final ConsumerFlowProperties flow_prop = new ConsumerFlowProperties();
flow_prop.setEndpoint(queue);
flow_prop.setAckMode(JCSMPProperties.SUPPORTED_MESSAGE_ACK_CLIENT);
```

Next a flow needs some knowledge of the type of queue that it is binding to. This allows the API to confirm with the Solace message router that the endpoint is properly configured for the application. In this example our queue is exclusive so we’ll set that in the endpoint properties.

```java
EndpointProperties endpoint_props = new EndpointProperties();
endpoint_props.setAccessType(EndpointProperties.ACCESSTYPE_EXCLUSIVE);
```

Both flow properties and endpoint properties are explained in more detail in the [Java developer documentation](http://dev.solacesystems.com/docs/enterprise-api-docs/){:target="_top"}.

Flows are created from Solace session objects just as direct message consumers are. Flows can take up to four arguments during creation:

*   An XMLMessageListener asynchronous callback object for receiving the messages
*   Consumer flow properties
*   Endpoint properties (optional)
*   Flow Event Handler (optional)

The following example shows you a basic flow receiver which receives messages, prints them to the console and acknowledges them as consumed back to the Solace message router so it can remove them.

```java
final FlowReceiver cons = session.createFlow(new XMLMessageListener() {
    public void onReceive(BytesXMLMessage msg) {
        if (msg instanceof TextMessage) {
            System.out.printf("TextMessage received: '%s'%n", ((TextMessage) msg).getText());
        } else {
            System.out.println("Message received.");
        }
        System.out.printf("Message Dump:%n%s%n", msg.dump());
        // When the ack mode is set to SUPPORTED_MESSAGE_ACK_CLIENT,
        // guaranteed delivery messages are acknowledged after
        // processing
        msg.ackMessage();
        latch.countDown(); // unblock main thread
    }

    public void onException(JCSMPException e) {
        System.out.printf("Consumer received exception: %s%n", e);
        latch.countDown(); // unblock main thread
    }
}, flow_prop, endpoint_props);
```

Then just as with message consumers, you must start your flow so it can begin receiving messages.

```java
cons.start();
```

Then after the consumer is started. At this point the consumer is ready to receive messages.

```java
try {
    latch.await(); // block here until message received, and latch will flip
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    System.out.println("I was awoken while waiting");
}
```

## Summarizing

The full source code for this example is available in [GitHub]({{ site.repository }}){:target="_blank"}. If you combine the example source code shown above results in the following source:

*   [QueueProducer.java]({{ site.repository }}/blob/master/src/main/java/com/solacelabs/getstarted/QueueProducer.java)
*   [QueueConsumer.java]({{ site.repository }}/blob/master/src/main/java/com/solacelabs/getstarted/QueueConsumer.java)


### Getting the Source

Clone the GitHub repository containing the Solace samples.

```
git clone {{ site.repository }}
cd solace-getting-started-java
```

### Building

Building these examples is simple.  Download and unpacked the Java API library to a known location. Then copy the contents of the `sol-jcsmp-VERSION/lib` directory to a `libs` sub-directory in your `solace-getting-started-java`.

In the following command line replace VERSION with the Solace API version you downloaded.

```
mkdir libs
cp  ../sol-jcsmp-VERSION/lib/* libs
```

Now you can simply build the project using Gradle.

```
./gradlew assemble
```

This build all of the Java Getting Started Samples with OS specific launch scripts. The files are staged in the `build/staged` directory.

### Running the Sample

First start the `QueueProducer` to send a message to the queue. Then you can use the `QueueConsumer` sample to receive the messages from the queue.

```
$ ./build/staged/bin/queueProducer HOST
$ ./build/staged/bin/queueConsumer HOST
```

You have now successfully connected a client, sent persistent messages to a queue and received them from a consumer flow.

If you have any issues sending and receiving a message, check the [Solace community](http://dev.solacesystems.com/community/){:target="_top"} for answers to common issues.
